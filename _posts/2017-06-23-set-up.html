<p>After many years, now that I have no time, I decided to create a tech blog. My intention with this is to have a list of things that I already handled in my daily work, and I want to store them somewhere to remember how to do it next time. Also to remember important links with interesting things. I could use this also to point my personal opinions to different topics or discussions.</p>

<p>First of all, configure Jekyll, learn about it and start writing. Hopefully, I will write down another post before one year ;)</p>

<p>Thanks to @syaning for the theme. you can found it here: [http://github.com/syaning/slim](http://github.com/syaning/slim). I just modified some parts, but almost everything is from him/her. Thanks ;)</p>
